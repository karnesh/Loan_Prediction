# Loan_Prediction

This is a binary classification problem for determining loan approval. 

## Models
I tried four different models (mentioned below) and compared their performace. 
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost

| Model                | Accuracy      |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| Logistic Regression  | 80.28552      |
| Decision Tree        | 71.15808      |
| Random Forest        | 80.4521%      |
| XGBoost              | 77.99838%     |

Random Forest works best closly followed by Logistic Regression while Decision Tree has the worst performance. 

## Things to try next
 - Grid Search for XGBoost
 - Feature engineering
 - Independent vs independent variable visualizations to discover some more patterns
 - Try ensemble modeling
